#Azure Storage
Azure Storage provides the flexibility to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data, such as documents and media files with Azure Blobs; structured nosql based data with Azure Tables; reliable messages with Azure Queues, and use SMB based Azure Files for migrating on-premises applications to the cloud.

#Storage Cloning
Windows PowerShell scripting provides easy and efficient way to clone storage data from one location to the next. Storage data can reside in either Azure Table Storage (ATS), Azure Blob Storage (ABS), or Queues.

Included in this depot are some quick templates to replicate and clone data from one location to the next

For C# implementation of the solution to cloning the ATS please see https://github.com/jsu800/azure_data_replicator
